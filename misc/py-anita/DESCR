Anita is a tool for automated testing of the NetBSD installation
procedure and the installed system.  Using anita, you can fully
automate the process of downloading a NetBSD distribution, installing
it in a qemu/gxemul/Xen virtual machine, booting the installed system,
and running its test suite.

By default, this package contains only anita, and does not depend on
any of the four packages one might use to run systems being tested.
