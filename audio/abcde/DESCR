abcde is a frontend command-line utility (actually, a shell script) that
grabs tracks off a CD, encodes them to ogg, mp3 or flac formats, and tags them,
all in one go.

abcde requires an encoder at runtime, but the package does not contain
any encoders or depend on any encoder.  (Possibilities are bladeenc,
fdk-aac, flac, lame, musepack, speex, and vorbis-tools.)
