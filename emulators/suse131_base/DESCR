Linux compatibility package based on the openSUSE Linux distribution.
Please visit http://www.opensuse.org/ for more information about openSUSE
Linux.

This package supports running ELF binaries linked with glibc2 that
don't require X11 shared libraries.

While this package contains binaries, shared libraries, man pages, and
similar files, it does nothing to cause your operating system to be
able to execute Linux binaries.
